# hello-world
First repository; will be used for PowerApps. Now I made a change.

So how many people did the same exrcise as I'm doing now?

I'm not a programmer, but someone who has done some programming in the past, using Algol68, Basic, Fortran, Turbo Pascal, IDS, Visual Basic, Swift, ... never at a professional level, but with good enough hands on experience to understand most if not all aspects of coding and to be able to hint where to find solutions or to choose for the best possible path forward.

I also strongly believe that programming is a linguistic challenge, much more than it is algorithmic use of mathematics or numerical simulations. So it helps to understand language with all of its flaws to minimize frustrating programming experience.

Lately I got totally excited about Microsoft's Power Platform. I will spent some time to get more hands-on experience with writing PowerApps (canvas, CDS and model-driven) and PowerBI.

I strongly believe that a platform such as Microsoft is unfolding at an incredible speed in these days will be a disruptive game changes for any current business activity.
